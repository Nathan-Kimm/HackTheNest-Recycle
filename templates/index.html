              <h1>Recycling Basics</h1>
              <p>Recycling is an essential part of reducing waste, conserving natural resources, and protecting the environment. By properly recycling materials, you contribute to a more sustainable world and help reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Here’s a guide on how to recycle effectively and make a positive impact on the planet.</p>
              <br>
              <h2>Understand What Can and Cannot Be Recycled</h2>
              <p>One of the first steps in recycling is knowing which materials can be recycled. Different recycling programs have varying guidelines, but the most commonly accepted recyclable materials include:</p>
              <br>
              <p>Paper: Newspapers, cardboard, magazines, and office paper are typically recyclable. However, avoid recycling paper that is greasy (like pizza boxes) or contaminated with food.</p>
              <p>Plastics: Many plastic items can be recycled, but make sure to check the recycling symbols on them. Plastics marked with numbers 1, 2, and 5 are usually accepted by most programs.</p>
              <p>Glass: Glass bottles and jars can be recycled, but it’s important to rinse them before recycling to avoid contamination.</p>
              <p>Metals: Aluminum cans and steel containers (like soup cans) are widely recyclable. Be sure to rinse them out before recycling.</p>
              <p>Items that cannot be recycled include:</p>
              <br>
              <p>Food containers contaminated with food (unless specified by local programs).</p>
              <p>Plastic bags: While they’re made of recyclable plastic, they often get tangled in recycling machinery.</p>
              <p>Ceramics or Pyrex: These materials don’t melt at the same temperature as glass, so they can’t be processed.</p>
              <br>
              <h2>Rinse and Clean Items Before Recycling</h2>
              <p>One of the most important steps in ensuring your recyclables are processed properly is to clean them. Food scraps or liquids left in containers can contaminate the recycling stream, making it more difficult to separate and process materials. A quick rinse is usually all it takes to make your recyclables acceptable.</p>
              <br>
              <h2>Sort Your Recyclables</h2>
              <p>Many areas provide curbside recycling bins that are divided into sections for different materials. If your area doesn’t offer this, or if you’re dropping off your recyclables yourself, it’s important to sort materials into categories like paper, plastics, glass, and metal. This sorting helps prevent contamination and makes the recycling process more efficient.</p>
              <br>
              <h2>Avoid Contaminating the Recycling Stream</h2>
              <p>Contamination is a major issue in recycling. When non-recyclable items are mixed with recyclables, they can compromise the entire batch, causing it to be sent to a landfill instead. To avoid contamination:</p>
              <br>
              <p>Do not place non-recyclable items in your recycling bin.</p>
              <p>Ensure items are free from food and other contaminants.</p>
              <p>Follow local guidelines for sorting and collection.</p>

              <p><strong>Paper</strong>: Includes newspapers, magazines, office paper, and cardboard. Make sure the paper is clean and free of food residue.</p>
              <p><strong>Plastics</strong>: Plastic bottles, containers, and jugs (marked with numbers 1, 2, and 5) are recyclable. Avoid plastic bags in curbside bins.</p>
              <p><strong>Glass</strong>: Glass bottles and jars are endlessly recyclable. Be sure to rinse them before recycling.</p>
              <p><strong>Metals</strong>: Aluminum cans and steel cans are recyclable. Always rinse them to prevent contamination.</p>
              <p><strong>Electronics (E-Waste)</strong>: Old electronics like phones, computers, and batteries can be recycled at specialized facilities.</p>
              <p><strong>Textiles</strong>: Clothes, shoes, and textiles can be recycled or donated. Damaged items may be processed into industrial products.</p>
              <p><strong>Batteries</strong>: Rechargeable, lithium-ion, and car batteries require special recycling due to hazardous materials.</p>
              <p><strong>Compact Fluorescent Bulbs (CFLs)</strong>: CFLs contain mercury and need to be recycled separately through special programs.</p>
              <p><strong>Cartons</strong>: Beverage cartons (milk, juice boxes) can be recycled once rinsed clean of food residue.</p>
              <p><strong>Tires</strong>: Old tires can be recycled into new products like playground surfaces or road materials.</p>
              <p>Proper recycling helps reduce waste and conserve resources, so always check local guidelines!</p>
